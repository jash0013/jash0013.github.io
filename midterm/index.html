        <h2>Life of a Monarch Butterfly</h2>
        <div class="wrapper clearfix">
            <img src="images/Butterfly.jpg" alt="Monarch Butterfly">
            <p>Monarch butterflies live in North, Central, and South America as well as Australia, some Pacific Islands, India, and Western Europe.
                Their markings include bright orange wings covered with black veins and rimmed with a black border and white dots. 
                Females have thicker veins in their wings.A monarch's brilliant coloring tells predators
                 "Don't eat me. I'm poisonous." A monarch's brilliant coloring tells predators: "Don't eat me. I'm poisonous." 
                 The most amazing thing about monarch butterflies is the enormous migration that North American monarchs undertake each year.
          Every fall, as cold weather approaches, millions of these delicate insects leave their home 
          range in Canada and the United States 
          and begin flying south. They continue until they reach Southern California or central Mexico,
           nearly 2,500 miles away!
          These international travelers return to the same forests each year, and some even find the same tree that their ancestors landed on.
          Some estimates say up to a billion butterflies arrive in the mountains of Mexico each year.
